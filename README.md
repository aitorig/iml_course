# iML course
## Introduction
The objective of this repository is to store the main exercises and lectures
used for the different iML courses.

## How to start
These are the requirements for the course:
- Have `python 3.8` installed in your system ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is recommended)
- Have [iML](https://github.com/aitorig/reactive_machine_learning) installed in your system (you can follow the instructions there)

The course material is divided in different blocks:

- The **data** folder contains the data files needed for the different examples
of the course
- The **basic course** folder contains the material (ppts and exercises) for the 
iML introductory course
